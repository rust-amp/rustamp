# rustamp-app

The application layer: the crate that assembles the player. It owns the clock
and the OS, loads the config and the skin, builds the audio engine, opens the
main window and routes commands and events between the headless UI machine
(`rustamp-ui`) and the engine (`rustamp-audio`). See `src/lib.rs` for the map of
the modules and `docs/tasks/N1-app-wiring.md` for the task card.

The binary is `rustamp`:

```text
rustamp [<file>] [--null] [--volume <0..=255>] [--skin <path>] [--seconds <n>]
```

## Headless mode — safe to run anywhere

```text
cargo run -p rustamp-app -- --null <file>
```

`--null` selects the deterministic null output and runs **headless**: the app
drives a virtual device instead of WASAPI/cpal and opens **no window**. This is
the mode the tests use (`tests/headless.rs` plays the repo's own 1.5 s FLAC
fixture and checks the exit code). `--seconds <n>` bounds a run; `--null` with
no file exits immediately.

## Windowed mode — Windows Sandbox only

```text
cargo run -p rustamp-app -- <file>
```

Without `--null` the app opens the main window and plays on the best device for
the host.

> **GUI must never run outside the Windows Sandbox.**
>
> The reference Winamp 2.95 is driven inside a Windows Sandbox on this machine,
> and a second window on the host would interfere with those captures. Run the
> windowed player only inside the sandbox. Everything else (builds, `cargo
> test`, headless `--null` runs) is safe on the host.

### A spawned child must never create a window either

**A console window counts as a window on the host.** Any code that spawns a
child process — tests, tools, examples — must therefore pass
`CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (`std::os::windows::process::CommandExt::creation_flags(0x0800_0000)`);
a console-subsystem child (`rustamp.exe`) otherwise gets a console window of its
own when the parent has no console.

`tests/headless.rs` does this in one place, `no_window()`, which **every** spawn
site goes through, and `every_spawn_site_is_guarded` fails if a second spawn
site appears or the flag is dropped.

The windowed player is not needed to verify this crate: `cargo test -p
rustamp-app` covers the wiring headless, and the binary is only ever *built*,
never run windowed, by the default test suite.

## The GUI rail

`window::run` refuses to start when the environment variable `RUSTAMP_NO_GUI`
is set (`window::NO_GUI_ENV`), and `rustamp_app::run` checks the same rail
**before** it builds the audio engine, so a mis-run fails immediately instead of
opening a window. `tests/headless.rs` sets it on every binary it spawns, so a
test that accidentally loses `--null` fails loudly rather than starting a GUI.

The one test that does open a window is `#[ignore]`d and sandbox-only:

```text
cargo test -p rustamp-app -- --ignored
```

Run it **inside the Windows Sandbox** with an audio endpoint available. It
spawns the player, waits three seconds, checks that it is still running (the
window opened and the event loop is live) and kills it.

## Windows of this crate

`rustamp-app` drives `winit`/`softbuffer` itself instead of reusing
`rustamp_ui::MainWindowPresenter`, because that presenter is a manual example
which drops the commands the UI machine emits and cannot route anything to the
engine. See the module docs in `src/window.rs`.
